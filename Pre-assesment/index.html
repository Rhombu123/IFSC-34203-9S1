    <h2>My Assessment</h2>
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>

    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
    <p>The &quot;alt&quot; attribute is used to provide alternative text for images when they cannot be displayed. It is essential for accessibility, as screen readers use this text to describe images to visually impaired users. The alt text should be concise and descriptive of the image's content or purpose. On the other hand, the &quot;title&quot; attribute provides additional information about an element and appears as a tooltip when users hover over it. While title can be used on various HTML elements, alt is specifically for images and is required for accessibility compliance.</p>
    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
